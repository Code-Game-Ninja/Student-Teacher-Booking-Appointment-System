## 🔄 Data Flow
1. **User** interacts with the web app (register, login, book, message)
2. **Frontend** sends requests to Firebase Auth (for login) and Firestore (for data)
3. **Auth** validates user, issues tokens
4. **Firestore** stores/retrieves user, appointment, and message data in real time
5. **Storage** handles file uploads/downloads
6. **Vercel** serves the frontend and handles deployments
